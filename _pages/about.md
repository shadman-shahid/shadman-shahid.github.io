I am currently a PhD Student at University of Southern California in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research focus lies in <span style="color:purple;">nanophotonics and metasurface design</span>.  

<!-- I am currently looking for graduate positions in labs focusing on **<span style="font-size: 16px;">nanophotonics, active plasmonics and non-linear optics</span>**. For my Master's thesis, I am working on enhancing non-linear optical phenomena with active plasmonics.   -->

I have done my M.Sc in Â [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE-BUET] from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][buet] with a specialization in Electronics and photonics under [Professor Dr. Anisuzzaman Talukder][Anis]. Previously, I have been  as a Machine Learning Engineer in  [ACI Limited][ACI].
 
 My research interest includes _nanophotonics and plasmonics_, _photonic design optimization_ and _photonic inverse design_. However, a thanks to my recent role as a machine learning engineer since July 2022, I also have workable expertise in _Machine learning/Deep learning techniques and tools_, especially in the context of serving a multi-faceted business institution. 

<!-- This interest has driven me to explore the field of ML/DL-assisted electromagnetic simulation and modelling.   -->
<!-- My greater goal is to work with enabled photonic computation and photonic devices. To be at the forefront of photonic integrated circuits research, building machine learning optimized devices. -->

I have previously worked with a special class of plasmonic lasers called **[Tamm-plasmon lasers][tamm-laser]**. My goal had been to devise a design for a tamm-plasmon laser, that could operate with two closely spaced modes. To that end, I, along with my former research partner [Shahed-e-Zumrat][zumrat] devised two different approaches. The first approach utilized **[a lateral redesigning of a simple rectangular nanohole array to a more complex merged lattice array][merged-lattice]**. The second approach relied on the utilization of **[two distributed Bragg reflectors, tuned to slightly different wavelengths][dual-dbr-laser]**


<!-- Apart from the published works, I am also currently exploring ~~the physics of Tamm plasmon laser working with the merged lattice array~~, **how to leverage non-linear effects in nanophotonic lasers.**.  -->
