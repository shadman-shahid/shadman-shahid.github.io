title: Things I do when I get some peace and quiet
description: I am writing this description as I am setting up this (for the lack of a better term) blog post. In an age of ultra-curated content this is a place where I come to violate all arbitrary standards of perfection. The thing is, I don't expect people to read any of the stuff that goes on here. But, if they somehow still manage to find this place out, cheers to them. If they manage to derive some benefit out of these, well double cheers to them. You know what, I'll make this place a secluded corner of the internet, so that it's difficult to find. "Why though?" - you may ask. Cause I believe these are precious.
